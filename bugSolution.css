To resolve this conflict, ensure that selectors are properly structured and appropriately used, either by increasing the specificity of the desired selector or using the `!important` flag.  However the use of `!important` is generally discouraged in well-structured CSS, as it can make your CSS harder to maintain.  A better solution would be to refactor the CSS. In this example refactoring involved creating a more specific class for the child element.
